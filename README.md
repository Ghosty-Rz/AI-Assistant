# AI Assistant with Avatar

Another attempt at making an AI assistant, except this time it would be with an avatar that talks to you...

The plan was simple:

1. **Voice Input (Optional)**  
   Have the option to speak through the mic to the assistant by using whisper (In case i wanted to communicate by voise instead of text, but i most likely would have kept it at text _personal preference)

2. **Language Model**  
   Use a language Model (i tho of it being powered by GPT)

3. **Voice Output**  
   Use any available voice online (i'm not picky)

4. **Text/Audio to Talking Head**  
   Time for text/audio to talking head (usually complicated but thankfully there are a lot of benevolent people that put their programs to be used as open-source so others don't have to spend time on that)
   It takes an audio and creates a moving head (basically deepfakes).

6. **Avatar Integration & all the rest**
   Now, i believed the struggle would have been at this stage of having to find a way to merge all of that with the virtual Avatar and the creation of the avatar.
   
     - because apparently, I need to have the avatar ready first, but i learned that i'd have to design and rig it myself using **live2D**. Like, what do you mean I have to do that myself? ( i honestly hadn't considered that at all) I tho I could just use a 2D image and have an AI move its mouth according to what is being said... maybe that is an option that I just haven't found more on how to do it)
       
    I already have the picture I want to use in mind. I was wondering what the assistant would look like, and then I remembered I have this picture and tho it would be a good fit.

**I believed THIS was gonna be my biggest worry or challenge, THAT is what i would struggle with...** 

I didn't think i'd get stuck at phase 2 (**language model**) i used an openAI API key... but i have to pay to use their available models. So, I looked for something else. 
- I thought about trying **DeepSeek API**, but you also have to pay for their key. So I turned to HuggingFace, got a key, and guess what? I found the DeepSeek model open-source and free to use.
  But it's fricking 688GB, what kind of computer can handle that ??? So, tell me why it has more than 1 Million downloads ???
  Anyway... so all i could use was gpt-2, and i tho it would be fine.
  
... I never expected it to be that stupid.***

it gave me much more nonsense (and sometimes so ridiculous it was funny) answers than what is portrayed in these screenshots ... too bad I didn't take pictures of them back then

Anyway, I digress. It took a whole day, I tho it was a stupid waste of time, I was already busy with other assignments and bla bla and so i gave up ... :((
:/ 
and I was a bit sad about that...

**So** to make myself a liittle bit better, I made this my wallpaper and put a ChatGPT shortcut next to it ... and called it a day ...
